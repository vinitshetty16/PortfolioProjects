# PortfolioProjects
In this repository, you'll find a collection of data analysis projects that demonstrate my skills in working with data to derive actionable insights. Each project is a testament to my ability to leverage SQL for data querying and manipulation, Python for data analysis and visualization, as well as Tableau and PowerBI for creating interactive and informative dashboards.

## Technologies Used
1. **SQL**: Used for data querying, cleaning, and transformation directly within databases.
2. **Python**: Employed for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.
3. **Tableau**: Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards that communicate complex data insights effectively.
4. **PowerBI**: Employed for building dynamic reports and dashboards that provide a holistic view of the data.

## Projects
Below are some of the key projects included in this portfolio:

1. **COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL:** This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset is sourced from [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
, providing comprehensive information on COVID-19 deaths globally.
2. **Nashville Housing Data - Data Cleaning with SQL:** - The project aims to enhance the [Nashville Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data) through cleaning and preprocessing the data using SQL queries for accurate and reliable analytical insights.
